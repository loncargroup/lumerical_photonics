The purpose of this new workflow is to integrate simulation and gds making.
This way, we can better track simulated device properties with real device properties.
Let's turn this into a set of functions

1. client
    Define cavity parameters cp, if we're doing optomechanics then pull via csv from matlab. Set up output .csv,
    which gives all the information we want for a given cavity.

    1. cavity, holes = make_cavity(cp)
    2. freq, vmode, qe, qi = simulate_cavity(cp, cavity)
    3. gds = gds_cavity(cp, holes)

    With all this information, we are going to want to put together all the information into a csv line, as well as the
    gds file so that we can move it around in a future parameter sweep

2. build_cavity(cp)
    Here we will use the cavity parameters to define the Lumerical object cavity (which we'll use to run the simulation)
    as well as Lumerical object holes (which we'll use to create the gds)
